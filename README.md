Background

In this study I have performed analysis on the current given data of school and student to extract a trend in school performances that will help the mayor to make decisions regarding school budgets.  the school dataset was composed of Student ID, school_name, type, size, budget and student dataset was composed of Student ID,student_name,gender,year,school_name,reading_score,maths_score. To analyse these two datasets were merged together in pandas dataframe. The analysis were carried on the jupyter notebook. 

Percent passing:

Dataset of 15 schools and 39,170 students indicates that the percentage for math is greater which is 86.07% then maths which is 84.42%.

Analysis by Budget:

Baily high school has consumed the maximum budget of $3,124,928.00 while lowest budget reciever was Holden high school $248,087.00. But with the performance Bailey High School is not in the top performing schools. 

Budget per student in school:

Huang High School has the higher per student budget which is $655.000, and Wilson High School has $578.00 per student allocates a lower budget per student. But with the performance Huang High School is one of the low performing school just like Baily high school for overall budget. I can conclude that the amount of budget is irrelevant in this analysis with school performances.

Scores of maths and reading:
From the findings of reading and math scores comparison with the government and independency. It shows that independent school has performed more in scores. Which could be related to the population size in government and independent school.

Increase in the population:
From the data it has been showing the relevancy that the higher the population lower the performance in the scores of reading and maths.
